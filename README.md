# Predictive-Maintenance-Practice
This is a Machine Learning Practice Case of Predictive Maintenance by Python with NASA's Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Data Set.
The popular predictive and classification algorithms were implemented to build this project.

#### The project was practived under the following environment:
* Windows 10 with Intel(R) i7-6700 CPU @ 3.40GHz, RAM 8G;
* Python 3.8 on Spyder IDE 4.0 (Anaconda3)

#### Packages used:
* Data Wrangling:	NumPy 1.17 & pandas 0.25;
* Visualization : Matplotlib 3.1.0 & seaborn 0.9.0 & Scikit-plot 0.37;
* ML algorithm  :	scikit-learn 0.21.3 & xgboost 1.0;
